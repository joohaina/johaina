<h2>Hello! I am Johanna S. Tarim, I am 17 years old</h2><p> I was born on November 9 2000 and I live in 
Gang, Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao also studying in Notre Dame RVM-College of Cotabato as an grade 11 student,
my strand is humms because I want to be a teacher, i want to make my parents proud of me in my chosen way. I am talkative,also they are calling me "kalog" 
because of my mouth, but most of the people surrounds me they thought that I am snobber or "maldita" I don't why becaue I know 
in my self that I am a noisy girl maybe that is my physical appearance to them.
